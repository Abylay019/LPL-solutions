# LPL_solutions
Here you can find some solutions of the book __"Language Proof and Logic"__.  
The files are in __prf__ format, which means that it needs to be visualized at the Fitch program.  
However, with the update (_01 semptember 2019_) __each file can be visualized as jpg format__ in [Images](LPL-Solutions/Images).  
  
_This is a repository for study purpose. Feel free to contribute._

## Updates

__Update__ _01 september 2019_ Added Images of the each file in the [Images](LPL-Solutions/Images/) folder. All the __prf__ files can be found at [All prf files](LPL-solution/All prf files/) to make your research easier.

## Notes 

- The Proof 6.31 prf __is not__ completed.
